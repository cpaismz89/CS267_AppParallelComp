# Parallelizing Genome Assembly
This assignment is an introduction to writing distributed memory programs for applications with irregular communication patterns.  Here, we'll be implementing a distributed hash table using UPC++.  We'll use our distributed hash table to evaluate one stage of a de novo genome assembly pipeline.
